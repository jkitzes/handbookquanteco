        <p>Welcome to the companion website for the book <strong><em><a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo139725700.html">Handbook of Quantitative Ecology</a></em></strong>, by Justin Kitzes. This book provides a hands-on introduction to quantitative research methods in ecology and conservation. Pre-orders can now be placed with the <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo139725700.html">University of Chicago Press</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Quantitative-Ecology-Justin-Kitzes/dp/0226818322/">Amazon</a>, and other booksellers.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Handbook of Quantitative Ecology</em></strong> was written by Justin Kitzes, currently an Assistant Professor of Biological Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh. More information on Justin's work can be found at the <a href="https://kitzeslab.org">Kitzes Lab website</a>.</p>

        <h3>About the Book</h3>

        <p>The goal of <strong><em>Handbook of Quantitative Ecology</em></strong> is to provide a readable, intuitive, and integrated introduction to widely used quantitative methods in ecology and conservation. Uniquely, all concepts and models are explained using only college-level algebra and spreadsheets.</p>

        <p>Each of the book's 20 chapters introduces a new idea by posing and then solving a specific ecological problem or question. The solutions to these problems provide an example of an important general concept that can then be applied more widely. Examples of questions include:
          <ul>
            <li>How long will it take for this rare plant to be excluded from this community? (Lotka-Volterra competition)</li>
            <li>What is the chance that I've just contracted a tick-borne disease, given that I tested positive? (Bayes's Rule)</li>
            <li>How much is an invasive insect population likely to grow in the next decade? (Age structured models)</li>
            <li>Is there more roadkill near the nature reserve or not? (Generalized linear models)</li>
            <li>What combination of habitat types will protect the most plant species? (Optimization)</li>
          </ul></p>

        <p>The 20 chapters are divided into five sections that cover difference equations, probability, matrix models, likelihood statistics, and a "grab bag" of mostly numerical methods.</p>

        <h3>Google Sheets Solutions</h3>

        <p>Google Sheets containing solutions to the problems in each chapter of the book are <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o_B16vDT6hDCAZ2np9c_Z8_A5630Hcq_?usp=sharing">available at this link</a>. These Sheets also contain all figures included in the book.</p>

        <p>The Sheets at this link are set to View only mode. To make a copy of a Sheet so that you can change its contents, sign into your own Google account, open the Sheet that you are interested in, and go to File&nbsp;&#8209;>&nbsp;Make a copy. This will save a copy of the Sheet in your Google Drive, where you can edit it.</p>


        <p>As noted in the book, readers are strongly encouraged to try to solve each problem on their own, beginning with a blank Sheet, before reviewing the solutions at the link above.</p>

        <h3>Errata</h3>

        <p>There are no known errata yet for this book, which just means that we haven't looked hard enough yet. If you find any issues or corrections, please email them to <a href="mailto:justin.kitzes@pitt.edu">justin.kitzes@pitt.edu</a>.</p>
